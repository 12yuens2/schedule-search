# Process Scheduling for Heterogeneous Systems
Using a version of the GEM5 simulator which reads binary text files as input schedules, a genetic algorithm was implemented to explore the search space of possible schedules on two different benchmarks. The goal is to understand the optimisation space and find a fast schedule through search techniques.
